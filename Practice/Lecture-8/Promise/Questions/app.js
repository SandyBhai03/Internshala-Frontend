// Qns 1. Write a function delay(ms) that returns a Promise which resolves after (ms) milliseconds. Use this function to log "Done!" after 3 seconds.

// function delay(ms){
//     return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
// }

// delay(3000).then(res => console.log("Done!"));
// const p1 = delay(3000)
// p1.then(res => console.log("Done!"))

// Create a Promise that resolves with the value 10, then chain .then to:

// -----------------------------------

// Qns 2. Create a Promise that resolves with the value 10, then chain .then to: Add 5 to the value.Multiply the result by 2.Log the final result.
